Fresh Vine offers a robust *Email Campaign* tool. This means we have provided you with simple tools to send beautiful emails to groups of people. This is not a replacement for your personal email account, or to send an email to a single person.  
Whether it's a group email, a community-wide email, or a message going out to a specific, filtered group of individuals, we've got you covered. There are a lot of exciting features in the email campaign system, so if we're missing anything, let us know!

## Duplicating a Message  
This can be done both from steps in the sending process, as well as after the message is sent.  


## Tracking Readership  
We want you to get the most out of the Email Campaign tool, and part of that means making sure your messages reach the recipients. We've done a lot on the back-end to make sure that happens, and have given you great tools to do everything in your power to ensure it as well.  
You can track the emails you've sent, compare your open rates with those from previous messages (both group and all-community) and compare how your community does vs. the industry standard. You can view your subscriptions, and see why certain individuals may not be receiving your messages. All of this can be found on the Email Dashboard, with links to previously sent emails.  


## Managing/Creating Email Templates  
Creating a template can really be as easy or as complicated as you'd like. We've tried to keep things clear, but we'll explain things below.  

### Automated Messages  
These messages are automatically sent to a person on the corresponding days (Birthday and Anniversary), or when you first enter their email address into Fresh Vine. The content can be edited from this page, as well as setting whether or not to have them send.  
The list of an individual's received emails (including these automated messages) is found on their profile page.  

### Preformatted Content  
Preformatted Content is different than a Template. An Email Template sets how the email will look - colors, fonts, backgrounds, etc. *Preformatted Content* is content that you'd like to have in each (or many) of your messages. It is generally (but not always) content that doesn't change, or may change slightly depending on the message being sent.  
	An example of this: You may have a monthly email that goes out, with a budget update. The budget update gets put in every one of these emails. It explains where funds go to, and how far along the community is, with raising, or keeping up with the appropriate funds. Rather than writing the same thing out for each message, you can write it once in the form of Preformatted Content. Now when you go to send the message, all you need to do is open the text editor when writing your email, click the Dynamic Content button ![Preformatted Content button](/assets/images/email/Dynamic-Content.png)
