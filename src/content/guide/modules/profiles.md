Your people are the heart of your community. So it’s the heart of our software. Everything you do within Fresh Vine revolves around the people in your organization.


##What is a profile?

People's Profiles tell you a lot about the people in your community. The profile holds everything from their picture, address, phone number and birthday to emails they’ve received from Fresh Vine and events they have attended. 

###Relationships
Add a spouse, children, parents, guardians and charges from this page. 
###Address Syncing 
When adding a young child to a parent’s page, you have the ability to sync their addresses. This will cause the child’s address to become the same as the parent’s. When the parent’s address changes, so will the child’s. When the child goes off to college, simply disable the address syncing so the child can have their own address, yet still be connected to their parents via the relationship.
###Giving Syncing
Giving Syncing is available for spouses. You can enter giving under either spouse, but when you go to send the year-end contribution statements, the giving will be combined into one export. If at any time you need to unsync the giving for a couple, just click the button - the contributions entered for each individual will stay separate. 

##Who has access to the profiles?

Everything on a person's profile is accessible, based on the permissions you have been given. If you don’t have access to view/edit giving, you won’t see it on a member’s profile page.
