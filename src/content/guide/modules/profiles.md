Your people are the heart of your community. So it’s the heart of our software. Everything you do within Fresh Vine revolves around the people in your organization.


##What is a profile?

People's Profiles tell you a lot about the people in your community. The profile holds everything from their picture, address, phone number and birthday to emails they’ve received from Fresh Vine and events they have attended. 

##Relationships
Add a spouse, children, parents, guardians and charges from the profile edit page. When you create a relationship, it creates it on both sides - meaning you do not need to create a wife for the husband, and also create a husband for that same wife. Also, when you add children to a parent, the child will be linked to the other spouse as well, as long as you make sure to "blend into family." If the child is the child of only one of the spouses, do not blend into the family, and Fresh Vine will only place that child with the parent you're editing.   
##Address Syncing 
When adding a young child to a parent’s page, you have the ability to sync their addresses. This will cause the child’s address to become the same as the parent’s. When the parent’s address changes, so will the child’s. When the child moves out or goes off to college, simply disable the address syncing so the child can have their own address set, yet still be connected to their parents via the relationship.
##Giving Syncing
Giving Syncing is available for spouses. You can enter giving under either spouse, but when you go to send the year-end contribution statements, the giving will be combined into one export. If at any time you need to unsync the giving for a couple, just click the button - the contributions entered for each individual will stay separate. 

##Who has access to the profiles?

Everything on a person's profile is accessible, based on the permissions you have been given. If you don’t have access to view/edit giving, you won’t see it on a member’s profile page. Most areas of Fresh Vine are modual, and are treated that way so the data you want to stay secure, does.  
For a list of what each access level allows you access to, visit "User Group Settings" in the Admin section of your Fresh Vine.
