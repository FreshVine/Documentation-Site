Setting your Primary Location is necessary in Fresh Vine. Once this is set, all maps within Fresh Vine will center on that location.  

This can be a great benefit, as you will be able to see where your community members live (and where events occur) in relation to your organization's locale.  

You can have more than one location set in Fresh Vine. If your community is multi-campus or has several main locations, add your other locations here. Be sure to select the *Primary Campus* button for one of them.
