## User Accounts
You need a User Account to log into any of the Fresh Vine Apps (Leader site, Portal site, Concierge site and the Event Kiosk).  
User accounts are managed by the Admin(s) in your community.  
User accounts can be granted, suspended, or revoked as needed (by a Fresh Vine Admin).  
Each person with access to your Fresh Vine should have their own, personal user account. Don't share!  
User accounts need specific *access* given to them. This is done by assigning each individual User one - or more - Access Groups. 

### How To: Add User Accounts

Navigate to Admin - Users - View Users. This is a list of all the active and suspended leader accounts (Portal accounts can be seen on their profiles).  

1.  Click the green *Add User Account* button. This will give you a modal window to add the User.
1.  Start typing the name in the box, and select the person from the drop-down. 
    *  If they do not yet exist in your Fresh Vine roster, you can add them from here - simply type their full name and click "*Create: their name*" then enter their email address. 
1.  Select whether you are giving them access to the Leaders Site (specific access will be chosen by you below), or the Portal.
1.  If you are creating a Leader account, choose the access groups for this individual. This is your opportunity to make sure the right individuals are getting access to the right areas of your data. You're in charge of the permissions here. 
1.  Once you click *Create User Account*, they will receive an email with a link. Clicking that link will let them choose a username, and password to use for Fresh Vine. It will also verify their email address. Their accounts will be pending until that process is completed.
1.  *Tip*: You can create more than one User Account at a time - just click the *Add Another Person* button. This will allow you to give several individuals User Accounts at once. This can be particularly helpful when giving several group leaders access, for example. They will all have the same access to Fresh Vine, so why not do it all at once?

### Access Log
We keep an Access Log for you in Fresh Vine. This records every time a User logs into Fresh Vine. It keeps the log in the Admin section of Fresh Vine, as well as on each User's individual profile page.  

### User Access  
Once you give someone a User Account, you also need to give them the appropriate Access, via Access Groups. Fresh Vine is built modulally, meaning that even though you have access to see people's profiles and groups, you may not have access to see contributions. To read more about User Accounts and Access, see the Users Module.  

We have preset Access Groups ready for you to use. However, you can create new Access Groups or change the ones that are there. (We recommend you try ours out first, to see how it fits for your community and its needs.)

User Groups are not the same thing as a Group (Groups -> Create Group) you create in Fresh Vine. *User Groups* are the way we help you manage security via access/permissions for the people who are logging into your Fresh Vine.  

Without an account and access, someone cannot use Fresh Vine or get any content from it. Since accounts need selected permissions before becoming active, another level of security is created for your organization's system. Keep in mind that Fresh Vine is a Leaders site, and because sensitive information may be stored, you won't want to give everyone in your community access to Fresh Vine. Keep in mind, however, that you do have the option to enable the *Portal*, which is built for your community members with limited access.  
 

## Account Types  
### Leader
Leader Access allows an individual to log into your main Fresh Vine leader's site. They are then given access via Access Groups.  
  
### Portal
Portal Access gives an individual access to only the Portal site (if enabeled). If a user has Leader access, they automatically get access to the Portal. However, if a user has portal access, they do not get to log into the leader's site.  

## Account Status  
*Active*: Keep users Active, who are actively involved and are using Fresh Vine.  

*Suspended*: Set a User Account's Status to Suspended when they are temporarily not working with your organization. This may be because of a disciplinary action, scheduled sabbatical or any other reason of your choosing. Suspended accounts can be made Active again.  

*Removed*: Removing a User Account permanently deletes the User Account. It cannot be reinstated.  
At a later date, you can create a new User Account for that personal profile if you wish. They will have to set up their account again, however with a new username and password.  

Suspending or Removing an account will disconnect any applications that user has established with the API.  

## Primary Account  
We require at least one primary account in Fresh Vine. It would be preferred to have more than one, however.  
The person/s with a Primary Account have access to (1) manage billing information, (2) request database backups, and (3) can close your Fresh Vine account.

## User FAQ  

#### Why should each individual have their own User Account?  

*  It is very important for each individual you give a User Account to, to have their own login. No need to create one for "Volunteers" that 10 people share. For security reasons, it is crucial that each person has their own account. 

#### What is a Primary Account?  
 
*  Every customer of ours needs to have at least *two* people set as Primary users. The reason we ask for two is so that if one of them leaves your organization for any reason, you still have the second to be able to carry out any of the tasks listed next.  
*  Primary Accounts are the only individuals who are able to adjust billing, close their Fresh Vine account, and request copies of your database.  
*  A Primary Account does *not* need to have full access (system admin)to Fresh Vine.  

#### How do Access Groups work?  

*  When creating new, or editing an existing User Account, you can select Access Groups. Access Groups allow you to give people specific access to certain parts of Fresh Vine. This way, instead of selecting every specific section of Fresh Vine to allow someone access to, you can just select a couple groups.  

#### Can I limit access for certain individuals?  

*  Absolutely. You have the option to give individuals limited (or full) access when creating their User Account, or any time after, by editing their User Account. 


#### What if someone with a User Account goes on sabbatical?  

*    You can change an individual's User Account Status whenever needed. Navigate to Admin - Users - View Users. Find the individual who's status you need to change, and click Edit. Scroll down to *Account Status* - you can select Active, Suspended or Removed (See the descriptions of Account Status above).  


#### What if someone is abusing their access?  

*    You can change an individual's User Account Status whenever needed. Navigate to Admin - Users - View Users. Find the individual who's status you need to change, and click Edit. Scroll down to *Account Status* - you can select Active, Suspended or Removed (See the descriptions of Account Status above).  


#### Can I edit existing Access Groups or add new ones?

*  Yep! Navigate to Admin - Users - User Group Settings. Select one of the Access Groups. This will show you what parts of Fresh Vine this particular Access Group gives you access to. You can click the Allow button to add certain portions of modules to an Access Group. You can also add Access Groups from this page.
