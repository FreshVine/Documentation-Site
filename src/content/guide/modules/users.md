# {{title}} Module

Most of Fresh Vine requires a user account to access. This makes the creation and management of these user accounts very important. Great effort has gone into simplifying the creation and management of these accounts.  
  
Every person should use their own user account. There is no limit to the number of users that you can have with your Fresh Vine account. Avoid user accounts designed to be shared with a group of people. These are personal user account. Don't share!  
  
**There are 2 types of Accounts:** Portal and Leader.
  
## Portal Accounts
These are the main user accounts for Fresh Vine. Most of your community will get a **portal account**. This only gives them access to use the [Community Portal](../../applications/portal/). There are access to manage for these accounts. They are restricted to content related to their person profile. What they can do in the portal depends on which modules are enabled by you. Users are able to sign up for a portal account on their own.  
  
### Who can Create an Account

## Leader Accounts
Think of a leader account as a user account with . Anyone who you need to do more gets a **leader account**. These accounts are also given access to the [Leaders site](../../applications/leaders/), and possibly the [Concierge](../../applications/concierge/) - if their permissions allow for it. Permissions must be set explicitly for each account. Leader accounts must be created/initiated by another Leader account with access to manage user accounts.  
  
### Upgrading a Portal Account  
If the person who needs leader access already has a user account this process is even easier. Simply navigate to their profile and then go to their **User Account** page. Click on to the Edit Account button. From this window you can change their account to **Leader** and then grant them the access they need. Next time they go to log in they will be entered into the leader site.

### Creating a new Leader Account  
Navigate to Admin - Users - View Users. This is a list of all the active and suspended leader accounts (Portal accounts can be seen on their profiles).  

1.  Click the green *Add User Account* button. This will give you a modal window to add the User.
1.  Start typing the name in the box, and select the person from the drop-down. 
    *  If they do not yet exist in your Fresh Vine roster, you can add them from here - simply type their full name and click "*Create: their name*" then enter their email address. 
1.  Select whether you are giving them access to the Leaders Site (specific access will be chosen by you below), or the Portal.
1.  If you are creating a Leader account, choose the access groups for this individual. This is your opportunity to make sure the right individuals are getting access to the right areas of your data. You're in charge of the permissions here. 
1.  Once you click *Create User Account*, they will receive an email with a link. Clicking that link will let them choose a username, and password to use for Fresh Vine. It will also verify their email address. Their accounts will be pending until that process is completed.
1.  *Tip*: You can create more than one User Account at a time - just click the *Add Another Person* button. This will allow you to give several individuals User Accounts at once. This can be particularly helpful when giving several group leaders access, for example. They will all have the same access to Fresh Vine, so why not do it all at once?


### Controlling User Access  
Once you give someone a User Account, you also need to give them the appropriate Access, via Access Groups. Fresh Vine is built modularly, meaning that even though you have access to see people's profiles and groups, you may not have access to see contributions. To read more about User Accounts and Access, see the Users Module.  
  
We have preset Access Groups ready for you to use. However, you can create new Access Groups or change the ones that are there. (We recommend you try ours out first, to see how it fits for your community and its needs.)  
  
User Groups are not the same thing as a Group (Groups -> Create Group) you create in Fresh Vine. *User Groups* are the way we help you manage security via access/permissions for the people who are logging into your Fresh Vine.  
  
Without an account and access, someone cannot use Fresh Vine or get any content from it. Since accounts need selected permissions before becoming active, another level of security is created for your organization's system. Keep in mind that Fresh Vine is a Leaders site, and because sensitive information may be stored, you won't want to give everyone in your community access to Fresh Vine. Keep in mind, however, that you do have the option to enable the *Portal*, which is built for your community members with limited access.  
  
  
### Your Primary Accounts
We require at least one primary account in Fresh Vine. It would be preferred to have more than one, however.  The person/s with a Primary Account have special privileges for your organization. A Primary Account does *not* need to have full access (system admin)to Fresh Vine but they must have a leader account.  They can:

1.  Manage your Billing Information and see your payment history  
1.  Request a database backup/snapshot of all your data  
1.  Close your Fresh Vine account  

  
## General Account Information
The following information pertains to both types of accounts.

### Access Log
We keep an Access Log for you in Fresh Vine. This records every time a User logs into Fresh Vine. It keeps the log in the Admin section of Fresh Vine, as well as on each User's individual profile page.  


### Account Status Levels
When you Suspend or Remove an account any applications that connected to the API will be disconnected. 

#### Active
Keep users Active, who are actively involved and are using Fresh Vine.  

#### Suspended
Set a User Account's Status to Suspended when they are temporarily not working with your organization. This may be because of a disciplinary action, scheduled sabbatical or any other reason of your choosing. Suspended accounts can be made Active again.  

#### Pending
When you create a new leader account it moves into a pending state. It will stay in this state until they finalize their account by setting their password. Once that step is completed their account becomes active.  
  
A portal user may have a pending account if their: 1) email address was already associated with a profile on your roster. And 2) they sent themselves an invitation from the Portal that includes that includes a redirection. This redirection will ensure that when they finalize their account they get sent back to the page they initiated the process from.   

#### Removed
Removing a User Account permanently deletes the User Account. It cannot be reinstated. At a later date, you can create a new User Account for that personal profile if you wish. They will have to set up their account again, however with a new username and password.  


  
## User FAQ

#### Why should each individual have their own User Account?  

*  It is very important for each individual you give a User Account to, to have their own login. No need to create one for "Volunteers" that 10 people share. For security reasons, it is crucial that each person has their own account. 

#### How do Access Groups work?  

*  When creating new, or editing an existing User Account, you can select Access Groups. Access Groups allow you to give people specific access to certain parts of Fresh Vine. This way, instead of selecting every specific section of Fresh Vine to allow someone access to, you can just select a couple groups.  

#### Can I limit access for certain individuals?  

*  Absolutely. You have the option to give individuals limited (or full) access when creating their User Account, or any time after, by editing their User Account. 


#### What if someone with a User Account goes on sabbatical?  

*  You can change an individual's User Account Status whenever needed. Navigate to Admin - Users - View Users. Find the individual who's status you need to change, and click Edit. Scroll down to *Account Status* - you can select Active, Suspended or Removed (See the descriptions of Account Status above).  


#### What if someone is abusing their access?  

*  You can change an individual's User Account Status whenever needed. Navigate to Admin - Users - View Users. Find the individual who's status you need to change, and click Edit. Scroll down to *Account Status* - you can select Active, Suspended or Removed (See the descriptions of Account Status above).  


#### Can I edit existing Access Groups or add new ones?

*  Yep! Navigate to Admin - Users - User Group Settings. Select one of the Access Groups. This will show you what parts of Fresh Vine this particular Access Group gives you access to. You can click the Allow button to add certain portions of modules to an Access Group. You can also add Access Groups from this page.
