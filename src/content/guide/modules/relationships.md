You can easily connect relationships within your Fresh Vine community members. By creating relationships, you have the ability to share giving data between spouses, sync addresses among family members or unsync either of the above to have more autonomous individuals. 

## Create Relationships

Click + Relationship button when editing a person's profile. Select whether you're adding a spouse, parent,  child, guardian, or charge to this individual. If the person is already in your roster, start typing the name and select from the drop-down once you see the name. If they are not yet in your roster, type the first and last name, and click Create 'Name' to add the new individual into your roster while simultaneously adding the relationship.  

Click the green *Create Relationship* button to complete the relationship process.

There are two types of Syncing you can use when adding and editing Relationships within Fresh Vine; Address Sync & Giving Sync. To turn these on or off, you need to be creating or editing a member's profile. If the buttons are green, syncing is turned on. If they are grey, syncing is turned off. 

 

Address Sync: Ensures home addresses and campuses remain the same between family members synced when enabled. Disable address syncing to allow individuals to have different addresses set from the rest of their family. Example: A child moves out of their parent's house. Unsync to allow the ability to enter a different address for the child, while still maintaining the relationship within Fresh Vine.

*Note: Updating addresses will only affect direct relationships. 

 

Giving Sync: If Giving Sync is enabled, no matter what spouse you look at, you'll see the complete list of contributions for the couple. It will also produce one unified giving statement instead of two. This extends into online giving, where both recurring payments and payment methods will show up on each profile.  


## Siblings  
Siblings: automatically found through a shared parent.  


Synchronizing Addresses: New relationships will be given this persons home address and locations.
Want to have this profile inherit the other persons address/locations? Create the relationship from the other profile.
