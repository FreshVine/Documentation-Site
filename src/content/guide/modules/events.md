# {{title}} Module

Events are used to keep track of what's going on in your community. You can set community-wide Events or specific Group-Events (they work the same). You can create stand-alone events or recurring/related events. You can keep notes on how events go (see: Event Outcome). You can keep attendance for your events. Events really give you a lot of bang for your buck when it comes to using Fresh Vine. They really help you understand who is involved where, when, and how often.  

## Community or Group Event?  
Access Required Community: Community:Events  
Access Required Group: Groups  

The Events module is identical in Fresh Vine, whether it's a group event or a community-wide event. The main difference is your access level. Once you have the correct access, create as many groups as you'd like (with approval, of course)!  

## Create an Event  
One way to make the most of Fresh Vine is to create Events. A few tips:  
  
*	Make sure your event names are original. You may need to create another similar event in the future, and you want to make sure the names stand on their own.  
*	It's a good idea to add a short description to your Event Details. As you have other staff or volunteers helping out in Fresh Vine (taking attendance for you, writing a note about the event, etc.), it would be helpful for them to see the Event Description to make sure they're in the right place.  
*	Event Start/End: When does your event happen? Put that time here!
*	Does it cost anything? 
*	Set your location!
*	Enter the address of your Event here. It will let people know where your event is when they look at it in the portal!
*	Does your event happen more than once? You might want to make Related Events! More on that next!
