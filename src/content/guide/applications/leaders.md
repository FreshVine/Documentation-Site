## Leaders Site  

The Fresh Vine Leaders Site is our bread & butter. This is most likely where Admins & Leaders in your organization will spend the majority of their time. The Leaders Site is by far the most robust application we offer, and helps you do a lot.  


### A Few More Details  

Well, the Leaders Site really does a lot. Lets list this out quickly (this is *not* a fully comprehensive list):  

#### General  

*  Use the Leaders Site easily on any computer or mobile device! We have built the software to be *responsive* - essentially meaning it changes and responds to whatever size device you're using.  

#### People  

*  See a high-level overview of how your members are involved.  
*  Manage your member roster. Import profiles from a spreadsheet. Filter your roster, export it, view it on a list or map.   
*  Manage individual profiles. Add Relationships, contact info, view attendance history, groups they're a part of, emials they've received.  
*  Add individual's contact info when you're out and about, and run into someone from your community (on your phone!).  
*  Input giving data quickly with your customized funds.   
*  View Giving Reports, export year-end statements and use our Giving Partners for easy online giving.  
*  Create events and keep attendance - for the whole community or for specific groups.  
*  Manage your regularly meeting Services, along with classes that meet during those services, attendance, and other metrics you want to keep.  
*  Send customized Email Campaigns - to your whole community or specific groups.  

#### Groups 
 
*  Create and manage groups - or let your group leaders manage their own groups!  
*  Create Group events.  
*  Keep Group attendance.  
*  Get Attendance follow up prompts for those who have missed events.  
*  Send Group emails.  
*  Moderate Groups - allow your key leaders to keep track of how groups are doing, and if they can help in any way.  

#### Admin

*  Set everything - from your organization's contact information, to people types, additional info, group categories, and giving funds. The Settings are for you to customize Fresh Vine to how your organization needs it.  
*  Manage your User Accounts. Give individuals appropriate access to Fresh Vine.  
*  View which Fresh Vine Apps are connected to the Leaders Site.  

#### Connected Apps    

*  Allow and set access to your Community Portal (an extension of your Leaders Site) for your members.  
*  Connect the Event Kiosk to your Leaders Site, so you can seamlessly check people in to your Services and Events. 
*  Make use of the Concierge Site in conjunction with your Leaders Site to quickly and simply add new members to Fresh Vine.
