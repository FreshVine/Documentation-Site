## Quick Start with the Kiosk

We recommend the GK420d model Zebra printer. There is a link to it on the Event Kiosk Page (though you don't need to purchase it from Label Value).  


### Setting up the Event Kiosk App  

After you've installed the app the screen will prompt you with a 6 digit code. Even if that window goes away the code will still work for 5 minutes. Enter it into your Fresh Vine account. You do this from the My Apps page (click on the user menu on the top right, then My Apps). On this page you click the 'Enter Code' button. Approve the Kiosk and you're data will start syncing in a few seconds.  
  
### Enabling the Kiosk  

You'll notice that every event, service, and service template page has an Event Kiosk settings box. Simply click the enable button and you're event/service will show up on the kiosk. You can further configure the appearance and some of the basic functionality from that settings box.  

### Connecting the Printer
Ensure you are using a printer that supports one of our supported label sizes. We have a Dymo and Zebra printer label that was support. Before you open the Event Kiosk App settings make sure you note the Admin Code on your [Event Kiosk]() page (in the purple box). The default code is 1905.  
  
Make sure that you install the drivers for your printer from the Manufacturer - not the ones that automatically are found by Microsoft or Apple (this has been known to cause the labels to print weird).  
  
In the application you click on the gear icon on the bottom left. Enter the Admin Code, and then click on the 'Change' button next to the Label & Printer section. We've gone to great lengths to make the setup easier for you, all you need to do is select your printer and the label size. You should be able to print a 'Test' label that will include 2 thin borders, or a sample pack of each available label.
