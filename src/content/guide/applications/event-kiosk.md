# Fresh Vine {{title}}
Elevate your events with the Event Kiosk. 

## Installing the Event Kiosk


## Quick Start with the Kiosk

We recommend the GK420d model Zebra printer. There is a link to it on the Event Kiosk Page (though you don't need to purchase it from Label Value).  


### Setting up the Event Kiosk App  

After you've installed the app the screen will prompt you with a 6 digit code. Even if that window goes away the code will still work for 5 minutes. Enter it into your Fresh Vine account. You do this from the My Apps page (click on the user menu on the top right, then My Apps). On this page you click the 'Enter Code' button. Approve the Kiosk and you're data will start syncing in a few seconds.  
  
### Enabling the Kiosk  

You'll notice that every event, service, and service template page has an Event Kiosk settings box. Simply click the enable button and you're event/service will show up on the kiosk. You can further configure the appearance and some of the basic functionality from that settings box.  

### Connecting the Printer

Ensure you are using a printer that supports one of our supported label sizes. We have a Dymo and Zebra printer label that was support. Before you open the Event Kiosk App settings make sure you note the Admin Code on your Event Kiosk page (in the purple box - only visible to administrators). The default code is 1905.  
  
Make sure that you install the drivers for your printer from the Manufacturer - not the ones that automatically are found by Microsoft or Apple (this has been known to cause the labels to print weird).  
  
In the application you click on the gear icon on the bottom left. Enter the Admin Code, and then click on the 'Change' button next to the Label & Printer section. We've gone to great lengths to make the setup easier for you, all you need to do is select your printer and the label size. You should be able to print a 'Test' label that will include 2 thin borders, or a sample pack of each available label.  
  
### Event Kiosk Function  

General - Allows anyone to use the kiosk to attend your event

Ticketed *(Coming Soon)* - Only allows those who already have a ticket to attend your event

Service and Groups - Allows anyone to use the kiosk to attend a Service, or any meeting groups

Only Groups - Allows anyone to use a kiosk to attend any groups meeting during a service.


### Splash Background Image  

You should ensure that your image is the correct size for your kiosks. It should be the same resolution as the device screen (minus the 43 pixel height of the bottom bar). The Kiosk will ensure that there is no background color showing. It will clip the either the top/bottom or left/right sides to fill the window.  


## Kiosk Labels
You have the option to print labels when an individual checks into an event with the kiosk. This label can be used for a number of things, but most often it is a name tag. You could also have people use it to mark their lunch, to vote/join a team by sticking it on a wall or tabel, or any number of other things.
Dymo Labels 30320 or 99014  




### Types of Labels
There are three label types available for use by a class. These are set on the same page where you would edit the group name and other information. The label types are described below.  
  
There are two additional labels that are generated based upon need. These are the bag and claim labels.  
  
The tag label is available for the detailed and standard labels, and allows you to add items at the check in for labeling other bags/items/assets accompanying the person checking in (backpack, diaper bag, coat, umbrella, bottle, blanked, etc.). There is no limit to the number of bag tags one can print.  
  
The claim label is generated as the label parents can use to remember their unique ID for that service, and to indicate what rooms they are in. Each claim label will hold up to 6 names. If there are more then 6 names, a second claim label will be printed with the same ID number.

### Label Samples
Below is a sample of labels as we imagine three famous artists attending your event as wee little ones. You can see the differences laid out in the table above visually on each label below. The label image is customizable, we have preloaded nearly 100 and you can also [upload you own](#label-artwork).

#### Detailed Label

### Testing your Printer
You can [download](/assets/images/event-kiosk/label_config.jpg) the image below. Then open it in an application that will let you print it to your label printer (the default application to open an image should work). It should fill the label with the corner marks visible. When printing select the option to scale to fit, or fit to page.

### Windows 10 Label Setup *in progress*   
  
If you are having trouble printing labels the follow the steps below to get yourself setup to run in Windows 10. The default driver that windows is likely to install may cause issues with how labels are printed with the Event Kiosk.  

1.  Download the **Dymo Label Software v8.5.3 Windows** (or most recent version) from the [Dymo Drivers page](http://www.dymo.com/en-US/online-support/dymo-user-guides). [Direct Download Link](http://download.dymo.com/dymo/Software/Win/DLS8Setup.8.5.3.exe)
1.  Install the Dymo Label Software. You do not need to install *Dymo Label* (their additional software) but you must install the included Print Drivers. Once the installation is complete move to the next step.  
1.  We need to open the **Devices and Printers** window. This is an easy way to get there:
   *  Click on the **Start** menu in the lower left corner.   
   *  Click on the **Settings** menu near the bottom.  
   *  Click on the **Devices** button.  
   *  On the right side of the window scroll down to the bottom. Under the heading *Related Settings* will be a link to click labeled **Devices and Printers**.
1.  Right click on your Dymo Printer


### Mac Label Setup *in progress*  

If you are having issues printing on a mac the following steps should help get you up and going. If not please contact us via support.

Each user on a Mac has their own settings. By creating a new user on the Mac for Check In, you can set the settings how they need to be for the printing and it should work as expected. Before we get into the steps for setting this up please ensure you are running the latest drivers for your printer. The ones included on your mac are likely out of date and could cause issues. [Dymo User Guide](http://www.dymo.com/en-US/dymo-user-guides) At time of writing the "DYMO Label Software v8.5.1 Mac" is the most recent.  

1. Create a new user profile from your mac's System Preferences. I used the name 'Check In' and didn't set a password so that it would be accessible to anyone. Once this account is setup switch over to it.

1. Create a Custom Paper size:
	- Open TextEdit (or any other program that will let you print)
	- "File -> Page Setup"
	- Select "Manage Custom Sizes" from the Page Size drop down
	- Add a new custom size using the key below.
	- Rename the custom size by double clicking on the default name. Set it to "Check-In Label" or something equally obvious.

    Dymo  
	Width: 2.13 | Height 3.97  
	Margins are Top: 0.23 | Left: 0.06 | Right: 0.04 | Bottom: 0.06

	Zebra  
	Width: 2 | Height 4  
	Margins are Top: 0 | Left: 0 | Right: 0 | Bottom: 0  

1. Open the system preferences and pull up the 'Print & Scan' window. At the bottom of the window there are default printer and default paper size options. Set the default printer to your label printer. Set the paper size to your label size we created in step 2.


1. Open the Check-In Application and navigate to the settings page. Put in your access code and click on the Set button next to the printer title. Choose your printer and select Landscape (the exception being those using a Zebra printer on windows who should choose Portrait).

1. **[Optional]** Since you've created a user account just for Check-In you can have the Check-In Application load automatically when that user logs in. Open System Preferences again, click on Users & Groups. Choose the Check In user from the left, and on the right half of the window you'll see two tabs - one of which says 'Login Items'. Choose the Login Items and then you'll notice you can add applications to this list. Simply click the plus icon, navigate to where you installed the Fresh Vine Check-In App (most likely in the applications folder) and set it to open when the user logs in. Now, come time for checkin, all someone would need to do is choose the check-in user and everything will open up automatically.

Test it, and ensure that it is all working correctly.


## Kiosk Designer in depth *in progress* 
The kiosk designer allows you to design how the Event Kiosk will function for each specific event. The allows for greater flexibility and utility from the same application, and hardware setup.

## Label Artwork
There are 80 images included with the Kiosk to make it easy to use. Beyond that you can upload your own graphics to be automagically synchronized with all of your Kiosks and printed out on name tags. This artwork can be used for:

*  Showcasing your Organizations Brand.
*  Branding a specific Event.
*  Easily identifying which class/group a person is a part of.
*  Match a student to a specific classroom or course.


### Adding your own Artwork 
If you are using a thermal label printer you should ensure that you are using images with only black and white colors. The thermal printer will attempt to print grays, but they look very poor. Beyond that try to keep your images square, and no larger then 400 x 400. Use a **.jpg** or **.png** file format. There have been issues printing large file size images so if you run into issues where hte image does not load. If you experience this try compressing the image better, or passing the image through [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) prior to uploading.

### Download the Preloaded Label Artwork
The artwork included is free for use in every way without the need for attribution. The images selected where purposed to be clear, simple, fun, and to express some basic themes (animals, transportation, hats, dinosaurs, and nature). While not comprehensive there should be an image or two already loaded to cover most situations. It was designed by [Lemmling](https://openclipart.org/user-detail/lemmling), [StudioFibonacci](www.studiofibonacci.com), [Bloodsong](https://openclipart.org/user-detail/bloodsong), and others.
