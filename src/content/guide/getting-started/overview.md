Fresh Vine is membership software, designed for nonprofit communities. This guide will explain the various apps, modules and settings within Fresh Vine.

##User Accounts
You need a User Account to log into any of the Fresh Vine Apps (Leader site, Portal site, Concierge site and the Event Kiosk). User accounts are managed by the Admin(s) in your community. 

##[Profiles](../modules/profiles)
Profiles are core of Fresh Vine. Profiles show you how people are involved and engaged in your community. They show events they've attended, emails they've received and read and groups they're a part of. It's your one-stop-shop to seeing the best ways you are able to engage and draw them in.
