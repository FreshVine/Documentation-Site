Fresh Vine is membership software, designed for nonprofit communities. This guide will explain the various apps, modules and settings within Fresh Vine.

## User Accounts
You need a User Account to log into any of the Fresh Vine Apps (Leader site, Portal site, Concierge site and the Event Kiosk). User accounts are managed by the Admin(s) in your community. User accounts can be granted, suspended, or revoked as needed.  

### User Access  
Once you give someone a User Account, you also need to give them the appropriate Access. Fresh Vine is built modulally, meaning that even though you have access to see people's profiles and groups, you may not have access to see contributions. To read more about User Accounts and Access, see the Users Module.
 

## [Profiles](../modules/profiles)
Profiles are core of Fresh Vine. Profiles show you how people are involved and engaged in your community. They show events they've attended, emails they've received and read and groups they're a part of. It's your one-stop-shop to seeing the best ways you are able to engage and draw them in.


## Events
Events are a great way to keep track of how people are engaged with your community and the things going on in it. Create events for the whole community, or for specific groups. With Events, you're able to keep notes on how things went, and as keep attendance for those events as well.  

## Groups
Groups can be used in several ways. Any type of group that meets affiliated with your organization - create a group for it. You could also create staff or volunteer groups. It's all up to you. You can create subgroups within the groups. With Groups, you're able to email the members, leaders, parents of kids in a group or spouses of those in the group. Create Events for a group so you're able to keep track of what each group does, and how people are involved and connected to your organization. The possibilities of how you can best use is are endless.

## Donations
Part of your organization probably includes keeping track of donations that come in. We've made that easy with our giving module. You can manually and very quickly enter donations that come in from each individual in their earmarked fund. Or set up online donations with one of our amazing giving partners so your community members can give to your cause online. By utilizing online donations, we've removed the need to enter contributions manually, and integrated with our giving partners to automatically sync the donations in Fresh Vine.  

## Communications/Email
We've built a robust Email Campaign system in Fresh Vine. We've taken the guess work out of creating beautiful email templates, so your messages look great, and professional, every time you send one. Send a message to your whole community or to specific groups. Filter the list to include only certain people in your community, so you can effectively target your messages to those people, making them even more effective.
